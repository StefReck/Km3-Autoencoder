#Basic settings:
# 0: autoencoder
# 1: encoder+dense from autoencoder w/ frozen layers
# 2: encoder+dense from scratch, completely unfrozen
# 3: Parallel supervised training (load in new frozen encoder epoch according to schedule)
#Advanced stages:
# 4: Unfreeze training: Like stage 1, but conv blocks are unfrozen every few epochs.
# 5: Adversarial Autoencoder stage: like stage 0, but with critic network and alternating which part of the GAN is trained
# 6: Adversarial Autoencoder: train only the critic network (for pretraining)
